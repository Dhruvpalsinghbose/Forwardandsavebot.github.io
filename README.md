## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-User & Session Management:** Securely handles multiple user accounts with encrypted session storage.
* **Job-Based Configuration:** Create, save, and manage multiple named jobs with unique configurations.
* **Context-Aware Configuration:** Configure job-specific settings with `/settings` or define global defaults with `/defaults`.
* **Flexible Forwarding Modes:** Choose per-job how to forward content:
    * **Fast Forward:** Maximum speed, preserves original metadata with a "forwarded from" tag.
    * **Smart Copy:** The recommended default. Removes the "forwarded from" tag, handles both text and media, and automatically falls back to re-uploading protected content.
    * **Private Re-upload:** Maximum privacy. Downloads and re-uploads every file to strip all metadata and enable advanced features like renaming.
* **Unified Destination Menu:** Choose your upload destination per-job.
    * **Cloud Storage:** Upload directly to **Google Drive** or **Koofr**.
    * **Telegram (Custom):** Send to any channel, group, or topic.
    * **Telegram (Private):** Send directly to your private chat with the bot or to your "Saved Messages".
* **Subscription Tiers:** Flexible plan system (FREE, STANDARD, PRO, POWER) with a unified `/myplan` hub.
* **Centralized Subscription Tiers:** Manages user access to premium features (FREE, STANDARD, PRO, POWER) through the central `@UpgradeNowBot` service.
* **Advanced Captioning Engine:** Dynamically generate custom message captions with prefixes, suffixes, word removal, and powerful regex replacements.
* **Asynchronous Account Verification:** On-demand, non-blocking status checks for external cloud connections from the `/my_account` menu.
* **Persistent Retry Queue (PRQ):** Automatically queues and retries failed messages, ensuring no data loss.
* **Administrative Tooling:** Owner and Admin commands for user management, system monitoring, and broadcasts.

### 3. Configuration Hierarchy

The bot uses a three-tiered configuration system, loaded in the following order of priority (lower numbers override higher ones):

**1. Secrets (`.env` file or Doppler)**
This layer is for secrets and critical bootstrap variables ONLY. It has the highest priority and overrides all other settings.
* **Required:** `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, etc.
* **Management:** Managed externally via a `.env` file or a secrets manager like Doppler. **Never commit this file.**

**2. Dynamic Settings (Database)**
This is the **primary source of truth for global admin settings**. These are settings that you can change live via the bot's `/admin` panel.
* **Examples:** `ALLOW_UPLOADS`, `ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`.
* **Management:** Modified in real-time via the bot's UI. Changes are persistent and take effect immediately without a restart.

**3. Base Defaults (`bot_config.json`)**
This file contains the foundational, non-sensitive default values for the application. It should be considered a fallback and is the lowest priority.
* **Management:** This file is part of the Git repository and should only be changed by developers to set new baseline defaults for features.
